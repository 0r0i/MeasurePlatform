## Measure Platform

The Measure Platform is a web application which allows to collect, calculate, store and visualize measurements by execution of measures defined in SMM (Structured Metrics Metamodel).

The Measure platform is built in the context of Measure ITEA 3 project. The goal of the project is to increase the quality and efficiency as well as to reduce the costs and time-to-market of software engineering in Europe (and the world :-)). By implementing a comprehensive set of tools for automated and continuous measurement, we provide a toolset for future projects to properly measure their impact.
